# `todo_db.mcp` — the MCP stdio server

This package is the agent interface for the tracker (ADR 0007). It builds the
server, resolves the state branch target, pins the worker identity, and
registers thirteen task tools over shared service operations.

## Layout

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `__init__.py` | Package doc and a `main` shim. |
| `__main__.py` | `python -m todo_db.mcp` → `server.main()`. |
| `server.py` | Launch args, stderr logging, `LaunchConfig`, `build_server`, lifespan, `startup_check`, `main`. |
| `target.py` | State target resolution (flag > env > upward discovery), pinned for the process lifetime. |
| `identity.py` | Worker identity (`--actor` → `TODO_DB_ACTOR` → instance-scoped MCP fallback) and the per-process session id. |
| `tools.py` | The thirteen task tools: `list_items`, `show_item`, `create_item`, `register_batch`, `update_item`, `take`, `prepare`, `bind_batch_pr`, `abort_batch`, `release`, `finish`, `renew`, `drop`. |
| `resources.py` | `todo://instructions` resource, `get_instructions` tool, and `todo/workflow` prompt — all the same text. |
| `instructions.py` | The workflow protocol text. |

## Tools

One server instance is one logical worker. Default identities are isolated per
server; stable explicit actors must not run concurrently. Blocking Git work
runs via `asyncio.to_thread`; there is no shared mutable connection to guard.

The first `register_batch` call that upgrades a state branch to schema 3 needs
`confirm_schema3_cutover=true`. Set it only after stopping or upgrading every
older process with access to that branch; schema-1 clients cannot read the
upgraded state, and there is no runtime capability negotiation.

`create_item` and `update_item` accept `not_before`, a future RFC 3339 time
with `Z` or an offset. It holds an open task out of the ready queue until that
time, and `take` refuses the task until then; `not_before=""` clears it. The
field lives in the detail file and does not change the schema version, so an
older server loads and keeps it but does not enforce the hold. Upgrade every
server with access to the branch before relying on it.

## SDK pin

`mcp>=1.10.0,<2`. The 2.x major is a breaking rename
(`mcp.server.fastmcp.FastMCP` → `mcp.server.mcpserver.MCPServer`, and
`mcp.shared.memory` changed) while this package is written against the FastMCP
API. The wire protocol is unchanged across that major, so client interop is
unaffected by staying on 1.x.

`FastMCP` does not forward a version to the lowlevel server, so `server.py`
sets `_mcp_server.version` directly; otherwise `serverInfo` reports the SDK's
version to every client instead of the tracker's.

## Snapshots

`scripts/mcp_snapshots/tools.json` freezes the registered tool names,
descriptions, and input schemas. `tests/test_mcp_stdio.py` compares the live
server against it, so any tool change must land with a regenerated snapshot.
