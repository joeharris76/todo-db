# Blog Workflow

Route the request below. Resolve voice before drafting or editing.

## Guides

Read project `_blog/STYLE_GUIDE.md` and `_blog/VOICE_REFERENCE.md` when they
exist. If they exist, do not load `~/.claude/blog/*`. If they do not exist,
read global `~/.claude/blog/*`. If neither exists, proceed and note the gap.

## Critical rules

- After cleanup, repository write actions use
  `shared-change-framework/SKILL.md` with prefix `docs(blog)` for the required
  named branch, verification, commit, and approved-plan PR. The `cleanup`
  action handles existing blog changes.
- `critique`, `editorial-review`, `audit`, and `deformulize` follow
  `shared-review-protocol/SKILL.md` [REVIEW-AUTH-001]. After findings,
  `critique`, `editorial-review`, and `audit` apply its L2 audit.
- Prefer official or primary sources. Cite research notes, verify unstable
  facts, and never invent results, prices, quotes, benchmarks, or facts.
